## üß† 3D Brain Tumor Detection & Visualization Using Real MRI Data
This project is a full pipeline for detecting, segmenting, and visualizing brain tumors in 3D using real-world MRI data from hospitals. Built as part of our final-year engineering project, it combines deep learning (U-Net and CNN) with medical image processing to analyze tumor regions and visualize their growth over time.

## üîç Key Features:
DICOM preprocessing and brain region normalization

3D U-Net segmentation for accurate tumor region detection

CNN classification for further tumor feature analysis

Tumor volume estimation and growth trend prediction

3D visualization of tumor spread using medical imaging libraries

Custom-built without tools like 3D Slicer for a fully native pipeline
